PDFChatBot is a Python library that enables you to build chatbots or question-answering systems for PDF documents without the need for external APIs. It provides a straightforward and self-contained solution for extracting information from PDFs, performing text analysis, and generating responses using pre-trained language models.

## Features

- Extracts text content from PDF documents using PyMuPDF.
- Splits documents into text snippets for efficient processing.
- Embeds text using pre-trained sentence embeddings (e.g., SBERT with MPNet).
- Uses pre-trained language models (e.g., T5) for text generation and question-answering.
- No external API dependencies â€“ everything you need is included in the library.
